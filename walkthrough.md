# User Walkthrough: Generating Student Reports

This guide explains how to use the **Report Manager** to review student performance, add remarks, and generate professional PDF report cards.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before generating reports, ensure that:
- **Scores have been entered** for the class in the Score Entry section.
- **Term Results have been calculated** (if your system requires a batch calculation step) so that Positions and Averages are available.

## 2. Accessing the Report Manager
1. Navigate to the **"Reports"** section from the main dashboard sidebar.
2. The interface functions as a "Command Center" for report generation.

## 3. Selecting a Class
1. **Session & Term**: Confirm the correct Academic Session and Term are selected in the top bar (e.g., "2023/2024 - Term 2").
2. **Select Class**: Use the main dropdown to choose a class (e.g., "JSS 1 Gold").
3. The **Class Roster** will appear on the left sidebar, listing all students in that class.

## 4. Editing a Student Report
Click on any student in the roster to load their workspace. The workspace has three tabs:

### Tab 1: Report Card (Preview)
- This is a **Read-Only view** that simulates how the final PDF will look.
- **Check Points**:
  - Verify the Student Name and Passport photo.
  - Review the Academic Scores table to ensure grades are correct.
  - Check attendance numbers.
  - If scores are missing, you must go back to "Score Entry" to fix them.

### Tab 2: Traits & Skills
- This section allows you to rate Psychomotor and Affective domains.
- **How to use**:
  - You will see categories like *Handwriting*, *Sports*, *Punctuality*, etc.
  - **Hover** over stars to preview the rating.
  - **Click** a star to set the rating (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent).
  - The default is usually 3 stars (Good).

### Tab 3: Remarks
- Use this section to add official comments.
- **Quick Chips**: Click any of the blue "Chip" buttons (e.g., "Excellent", "Promoted") to instantly fill the text box with a standard phrase.
- **Templates**: Use the dropdown menu to select from a list of common remarks.
- **Custom Text**: You can type (or edit) the remark manually in the text area for a personalized touch.

## 5. Saving and Generating
1. Once you are satisfied with the Skills and Remarks, click the **"Save & Print"** button in the top right corner.
2. **Action**: The system will:
   - Save your ratings and remarks to the database.
   - Generate a high-quality PDF report card.
   - Open the PDF in a **new browser tab**.
3. **Print/Download**:
   - In the new tab, use your browser's PDF controls.
   - Click the **Printer Icon** to print directly to paper.
   - Click the **Download Icon** (arrow) to save the file to your computer.

## 6. Batch Processing (Start Over)
To move to the next student:
1. Close the PDF tab.
